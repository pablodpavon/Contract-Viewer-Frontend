# Business Analyst Case Study: Read-Only Contract Viewer Interface  
_A functional UI specification for archived policy access in a regulated environment._

## Contract Viewer Frontend – Read-Only Interface for Archived Policies

## Overview  
This project defines the functional and business requirements for a read-only frontend interface that allows internal users to access archived contract data. It was part of a digital transformation effort by a large European insurer, enabling departments like Claims, Legal, and Finance to retrieve historical policy and partner information.  
_Company and system names have been modified to protect confidentiality._

## Business Problem  
As part of the decommissioning of a legacy insurance platform, historical policy data was migrated to an internal repository. However, business units still needed fast, secure, and structured access to that data — for audits, customer service, compliance checks, and legal reviews.  
This project addressed that need by specifying a user-friendly, role-based frontend that provides secure, read-only access to archived contracts.

## My Role  
As Business Analyst, I was responsible for:

- Defining the functional scope and tab structure for the frontend  
- Mapping backend tables to logical UI sections  
- Writing validation rules for contract and partner searches  
- Designing access control based on Active Directory roles  
- Collaborating with stakeholders across departments to define user journeys  
- Documenting frontend behavior for all key use cases  
- Supporting accessibility and auditability requirements  

## Tools and Methods  

- Functional specification (MS Word / PDF)  
- Process analysis and role mapping  
- UX/UI collaboration (wireframe definition support)  
- Stakeholder interviews and workshops  
- Jira for issue and task tracking  
- Accessibility and audit compliance guidelines  

## Project Steps  

1. Defined the purpose and scope of the interface  
2. Organized backend data into user-facing tabs and views  
3. Documented all search parameters and validation logic  
4. Structured detailed field breakdowns per frontend tab  
5. Designed role-based access restrictions  
6. Captured representative user journeys  
7. Specified logging and audit requirements  
8. Coordinated reference design and mockup guidance  
9. Outlined pending approvals and open design items  

## Deliverables  

- Functional specification document for frontend  
- Tab structure with mapped backend data sources  
- Search validation rules and field definitions  
- Access matrix by department and role  
- Defined user journeys and frontend behaviors  
- Logging and accessibility requirements  

## Results and Impact  

- Provided a clear blueprint for frontend developers and UX designers  
- Ensured all departments had structured access to only the data they needed  
- Minimized risk of unauthorized access to sensitive financial or legal information  
- Set the foundation for a sustainable archive access strategy post-system retirement  
- Helped standardize how legacy data is reused internally for support and audits  

## What I Learned  

- How to balance functional clarity with technical constraints in frontend specs  
- Writing precise access rules across diverse business roles  
- Ensuring frontend usability while meeting compliance and audit requirements  

## How Others Can Learn from This  

Analysts designing read-only interfaces for archived or regulated data can benefit from:

- Tab-based structuring to separate sensitive or complex data  
- Validation rules that prevent poor search input and improve efficiency  
- Documenting access levels and logging needs from the start
